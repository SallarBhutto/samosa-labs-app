🚀 Goal:
Build a full-stack license server and admin dashboard that enables users to purchase and manage subscriptions for the QualityBytes app. Upon successful Stripe payment, a license key is generated and sent to the user. The app must support both customer-facing and admin-facing functionalities.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js with Express

Database: PostgreSQL

Auth: JWT-based or session-based (your choice)

Payments: Stripe (recurring billing)

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (or use EJS for server-side rendering)

Deployment: Replit

📦 Core Features:
🧑‍💻 1. User Authentication
Sign up / Log in

Password hashing

JWT/session management

💳 2. Subscription Plans
Multiple plans (e.g., Solo, Team, Enterprise)

Each plan defines:

Price

Allowed users per license

Access level

💰 3. Stripe Integration
Stripe checkout for recurring subscriptions

Webhooks to handle successful payments, renewals, and cancellations

Automatically activate license upon successful payment

🔑 4. License Key Management
Generate a unique license key on successful payment

Store in DB with reference to user and plan

Support multiple keys per account (for teams)

✅ 5. License Validation API
An endpoint like POST /validate-license

Accepts license key and returns validity status, user info, plan info

Used by the QualityBytes app to verify access

🧑‍💼 6. Admin Panel
Login-protected admin interface

View list of users and their subscriptions

View license keys and their status

Revoke/disable a license key

Filter users by plan or payment status

📊 7. Customer Dashboard
Users can log in to view:

Current subscription plan

License key(s)

Team members (if supported by plan)

Option to cancel or change plan

Usage status

👥 8. Team Management (if plan allows)
User can invite/manage additional team members (based on plan limits)

Optionally send invite links via email or code

🧩 Additional Notes:
Keep the backend modular and API-first (consider future frontend/mobile integrations).

Ensure license keys are securely generated and cannot be brute-forced.

Create basic but usable UI for both customer and admin views.

Stripe test mode is fine for now.
